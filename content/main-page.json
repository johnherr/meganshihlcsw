            "I find joy in working with clients who are feeling \"stuck.\" This can look like a variety of ways: feeling stuck in relationships; stuck in unhealthy patterns; stuck in emotions that make it difficult to experience healing, etc. You will be a good fit for me if you're someone who has had a history of painful and wounding events that you've pushed aside, and are now sensing the impacts of those moments. As a trauma-informed therapist, I work with my clients to make sense of their history, change the narratives that might be causing them suffering, and to create a new story that allows authentic flourishing.",
            "Alongside a psychodynamic approach, I offer specific trauma interventions including EMDR and CPT. I strive to see my clients not only connect the present symptoms with the past, but to make distinct behavioral changes. As your therapist, you will experience not only clinical support, but a genuine relationship that I believe paves the way for lasting change.",
            "I stand by research that shows that therapy is most effective when therapeutic alliance between client and therapist is strong, so if it does not feel like I will be the best therapy fit for you, I will support you in finding other resources. To learn more about me and my therapy style, I invite you to reach out for a free 15-min consult."
